Hi baby,

I’m so sorry for hurting you. I know words can’t erase the amount of pain I put you through. But I am genuinely sorry. Wallahi, I’ll make sure this never happens again. I know I should have talked to you before ending things like that. I know I should have been more understanding. I know you were busy, and I understand that you have a household to manage and that your focus right now is your career.

I’m so sorry. I promise I’ll never hurt you again. I promise to always communicate before making any stupid decisions.

Please give me one more chance. I miss you so much. I miss how we used to be. I miss your smile, your jokes, and the way you used to annoy me.

I love you so much, more than you can ever imagine. I want to grow old with you. I want to see you win, buy that BMW you have always dreamed of, and watch you achieve it with happy tears in my eyes. I want to see you achieve all your dreams, and I promise to always have your back and your support system and encourage you even on your worst days.

I want to see you win in life. I want to see us finally make it, even after all the problems we are going to face in the future, and one day say, “We finally made it.” I want us to go for Umrah after our nikkah, travel the world together, go on that all-India trip and everywhere else with you.

I want to see you become the best father to our kids, which you definitely will be. I want to see you take them out, send them to school, and even get them married  and I want us to see it all together.

I know I have been very cold towards you, and every time we fight, I realize how much you mean to me and how much I love you. I hope we never fall out of love with each other and that we always win. Please give me a chance to make this right.

I love you, always and forever.❤️
